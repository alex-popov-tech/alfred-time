# Alfred-Time

Very (very) basic workflow to start and stop timers for Toggl and/or Harvest services through Alfred.

# Why

I prefer using Toggl for tracking time, I like their dashboard and reports better. But I use Harvest for invoices. So instead of starting both services separately (ðŸ˜´) separately, I did the workflow so I can start and stop all services in one shot.

# Current features

* Generate and open default workflow config file at first start
* Launch edit of workflow config file through Alfred if needed
* Start timer for Toggl and/or Harvest (as defined in config) with default project/task/tag
* Stop current timer for Toggl and/or Harvest (as defined in config)

# How to use

# Todo
