# Alfred-Time

Very (very) basic workflow to start and stop timers for [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) and/or [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) services through [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com/).

# Why

I prefer using Toggl for tracking time, I like their dashboard and reports better. But I use Harvest for invoices. So instead of starting both services separately (ðŸ˜´) separately, I did the workflow so I can start and stop all services in one shot.

# Current features

* Generate and open default workflow config file at first start
* Launch edit of workflow config file through Alfred if needed
* Start timer for Toggl and/or Harvest (as defined in config) with default project/task/tag
* Stop current timer for Toggl and/or Harvest (as defined in config)

# How to use

## Config file

The config file contains 3 sections:

1. "workflow": you don't need to touch this, this is used as a cache by the workflow
2. "toggl": this is where you enter your Toggl info:
  * "is_active": true if you want to use Toggl, false otherwise
  * "api_token": your API Token to connect to Toggl (found in Toggl account settings)
  * "default_project_id": ID of the default project for your Toggl timers (if you want one)
  * "default_tags": list of default tags for your Toggl timers (if you want any)
3. "harvest": this is were you enter your Harvest info:
  * "is_active": true if you want to use Harvest, false otherwise
  * "api_token": this is a base64 encode of your Harvest credentials. You can encode online here: [base64 encode](https://www.base64encode.org/). Type "YOUR_HARVEST_USERNAME:YOUR_HARVEST_PASSWORD", encode, and paste the result in the config file.
  * "domain": your Harvest domain (https://DOMAIN.harvestapp.com/welcome)
  * "default_project_id": ID of the default project for your Harvet timers (if you want one)
  * "default_task_id": Id of the default task for your Harvet timers (if you want one)

# Todo

* Allow choice of default project, or not at all
* Allow choice of default tags/tasks, or not at all
* See reports directly in Alfred
* See info about current running timer (project, tags/tasks, running time, etc...)
